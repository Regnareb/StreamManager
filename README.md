# Stream Manager

**Switch automatically the title of your stream and the game category on Mixer/Twitch/Youtube/Facebook when you are streaming**

- It can pauses all services and processes that impede the upload bandwidth like *Dropbox, Backblaze, Duplicati*... or disturb the stream like *Synergy*.
- Every X seconds it checks the foreground windows and changes the game on your streams automatically (category/title/description/tags).
- With a push of a shortcut you can create Clips of the last seconds of streaming for services that supports it.
- Can be started/stopped and monitored remotely or directly in OBS.
- Do not impede performances and can actually improve them drastically with the pause process functionality.
